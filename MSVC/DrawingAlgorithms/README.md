# Implementation of basic 2D drawing algorithms 

### Supports
* Bresenham
* Midpoint

### Modes
* Line
    * Draw a line with the mouse
    * Start point will be the MouseDown location
    * End point MouseUp location
    * TODO: support everything else than a slope between 0..1 in x-direction
* Circle
    * Draw a line with the mouse
    * Center will be the MouseDown location
    * Radius will be the distance between MouseUp location and center
